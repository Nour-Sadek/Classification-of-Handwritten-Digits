# Classification of Handwritten Digits

### About
In this project, we are going to explore the main classification algorithms and 
learn how to find and train the best possible model for the classification of 
handwritten digits. We will need to process a dataset that includes images of 
handwritten numbers from 0 to 9. The ultimate goal is to train the model to 
identify a digit on the picture.

### Learning Outcomes of the Project
Get hands-on experience with the Keras dataset, train a variety of classification 
algorithms, and find the best one using scikit-learn tools.

### Learning Outcomes of Each Stage of the Project
_Stage 1_ : Figure out how to load the dataset from the external resource, 
preprocess arrays, and provide general information about the data.

_Stage 2_ : Split the data into train and test sets and verify the class distribution.

_Stage 3_ : Explore sklearn classification algorithms, train the models, and 
compare the results.

_Stage 4_ : Normalize data, train the models, and explore if that improves the results.

_Stage 5_ : Search through classifier parameter values and find a set of parameters 
that yields the best result.

# General Info

To learn more about this project, please visit 
[HyperSkill Website - Classification of Handwritten Digits](https://hyperskill.org/projects/205).

This project's difficulty has been labelled as __Challenging__ where this is how 
HyperSkill describes each of its four available difficulty levels:

- __Easy Projects__ - if you're just starting
- __Medium Projects__ - to build upon the basics
- __Hard Projects__ - to practice all the basic concepts and learn new ones
- __Challenging Projects__ - to perfect your knowledge with challenging tasks

This Repository contains one .py file:

    analysis.py - Contains the code used to complete the project's requirements

Project was built using python version 3.11.3

# How to Run

Download the analysis.py file to your local repository and open the project in your choice 
IDE and run the project. The performance of four models - Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, 
Decision Tree, and Random Forest - were compared to each other and evaluated using 
the accuracy metric. Please read each Stage's docstring to know the requirements 
of each stage and understand the output of the program.
